# Ribcage-Google-Maps <a name="ribcage-google-maps"></a>

This is the main Ribcage-Google-Maps module. It represents a one-stop shop for
all other modules and a namespace creator when not used with an AMD loader such
as RequireJS.

You should generally require indivudal modules instead of this one. However, if
you are not using an AMD module loader, you _must_ load this module first.
